# Generate art ideas with python
This was a simple project made as an example for the APCS create task. The goal of this application is to generate ideas for art using predetermined sentence stems. Currently a lot of functionality is lacking from it but it should give you a good idea of a basic create task. Under no circumstances can this project be submitted as if it is your own.

## Usage
To use, just open the directory and run with Python 3.7x+.
